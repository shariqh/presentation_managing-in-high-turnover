						<h3>Is it a numbers problem or a people problem?</h3>

					<section>
						If you found most of this presentation useful so far, you already have the wrong lens on &#128083;
					</section>
					<section>
						We're so entrenched in the numbers because that's what we've been taught, that we've forgotten about the people

						<h3>Let's talk about the people &#128106;</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h4>Ask yourself these questions - be honest</h4>
					</section>
					<section>
						When was the last time I asked someone what they wanted from their role?
					</section>
					<section>
						When was the last time I was able to provide it?
					</section>
					<section>
						Do I actually care about the careers and lives of the people around me?
					</section>
					<section>
						What am I willing to do to help someone else meet their goals?
					</section>
					<section>
						If your answers were never, never, no, and not really then you do not need to manage people
						<small>Focus your energy elsewhere - no one will be mad</small>
					</section>
					<section>
						For the rest of you, hangout and let's chat &#128586;

						<h3>I know I said it's not about numbers, but...</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						Almost two-thirds of engineers who recently left their jobs said they would have stayed had their employer taken steps to create a more positive and respectful work environment
					</section>
					<section>
						While 52% of employees exiting voluntarily said their manager or organization could have done something to prevent them from leaving their job
					</section>
					<section>
						This means that we are missing the opportunities to support and make the lives of those around us better &#128640;
					</section>

					<section>
						<h3>So here's some easy tips &#129297;</h3>
						<small>No, not cash tips</small>
					</section>
					<section>
						Be organized and detailed from onboarding to role-off
						<small>Onboarding should include specific role expectations (in addition to the other organizational information e.g. org tree, helpful tips, basic culture info)</small>
					</section>
					<section>
						Assign a mentor/coach who is not the direct manager
						<small>No one feels good bothering a direct manager about every question - especially technical ones. Lean on the team leads and more senior team members</small>
					</section>
					<section>
						Set up touch points often
						<small>One on one time is underrated. Try to talk to team members weekly and ask them questions about their current roles, accomplishments and where they would like help</small>
					</section>
					<section>
						Document everything and over communicate
						<small>It is very important that all relevant team members know what is being worked on, but also that their accomplishments are documented timely</small>
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>Now what?</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p>Remember that it is each of our individual responsibilites to create a strong, inclusive culture that...</p>
						<p>Provides autonomy</p>
						<p>Makes work enjoyable</p>
						<p>Develops skillsets</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						Whether you are a junior developer or a CEO &#128187;
					</section>
					<section>
						üôå It must be your personal mission statement 
					</section>
				</section>
				<section>
					<section>
						<h3>The End</h3>
					</section>
					<section>
						<p style="font-size:11px">But seriously, just try talking to the people you manage, and actually care about them on a personal level.</p>
